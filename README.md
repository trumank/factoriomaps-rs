# factoriomaps-rs

Extremely fast Factorio map renderer inspired by
https://github.com/L0laapk3/FactorioMaps.

This is a proof of concept and lacks many features of the original version.

Cuts out a significant amount of disk IO by:
 - using `LD_PRELOAD` to inject the tile processing lib into Factorio which
   intercepts screenshot writing calls preventing intermediate tiles from hitting
   the disk
 - rendering zoom levels starting at the highest zoom and working outward, only
   ever writing tiles at each stage and never reading back in for the next level

Scales tiles immediately as they are generated by Factorio so the bottleneck
likely ends up being how fast Factorio can render and serialize PNGs.

## Usage

    cargo run --release render path/to/factorio/directory/ output/directory/ path/or/map/name

## TODOs
 - [ ] actual error handling
 - [ ] setting day/night
 - [ ] configurable tile pruning
 - [ ] configurable zoom/resolution
 - [ ] map tags
 - [ ] etc. etc. etc.
