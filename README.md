# factoriomaps-rs

Extremely fast Factorio map renderer inspired by
https://github.com/L0laapk3/FactorioMaps.

This is a proof of concept and lacks many features of the original version.

Cuts out a significant amount of disk IO by:
 - implementing and mounting a FUSE filesystem under the `script-output`
   directory to prevent intermediate tiles from hitting the disk
 - rendering zoom levels starting at the highest zoom and working outward, only
   ever writing tiles at each stage and never reading back in for the next level

Scales tiles immediately as they are generated by Factorio so the bottleneck
likely ends up being how fast Factorio can render and serialize PNGs.


## TODOs
 - [ ] actual error handling
 - [ ] multiple surfaces
 - [ ] setting day/night
 - [ ] configurable tile pruning
 - [ ] configurable zoom/resolution
 - [ ] map tags
 - [ ] etc. etc. etc.
